        <b> Next day</b> he was to hide himself, but no matter how he puzzled
        his brains over it, he did not know where. He went into the forest to
        the raven and said, I let you live on, so now tell me where I am to hide
        myself, so that the king's daughter will not see me. The raven hung his
        head and thought it over for a long time. At length he croaked, I have
        it. He fetched an egg out of his nest, cut it into two parts, and shut
        the youth inside it, then made it whole again, and seated himself on it.
        When the king's daughter went to the first window she could not discover
        him, nor could she from the others, and she began to be uneasy, but from
        the eleventh she saw him. She ordered the raven to be shot, and the egg
        to be brought and broken, and the youth was forced to come out. She
        said, for once you are excused, but if you do not better than this, you
        are lost.
