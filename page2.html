                    <b> Three brothers appeared before her,</b> and announced to her that they
                    were desirous of trying their luck. The eldest believed he would be quite
                    safe if he crept into a lime-pit, but she saw him from the first window,
                    made him come out, and had his head cut off. The second crept into the
                    cellar of the palace, but she perceived him also from the first window,
                    and his fate was sealed. His head was placed on the nine and ninetieth
                    post. Then the youngest came to her and entreated her to give him a day
                    for consideration, and also to be so gracious as to overlook it if she
                    should happen to discover him twice, but if he failed the third time, he
                    would look on his life as over. As he was so handsome, and begged so
                    earnestly, she said, yes, I will grant you that, but you will not succeed.
