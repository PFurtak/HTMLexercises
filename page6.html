                    <b> On the last day,</b> he went with a heavy heart into the country, and
                    met the fox. You know how to find all kinds of hiding-places, said he, I
                    let you live, now advise me where I shall hide myself so that the king's
                    daughter shall not discover me. That's a hard task, answered the fox,
                    looking very thoughtful. At length he cried, I have it, and went with him
                    to a spring, dipped himself in it, and came out as a stall-keeper in the
                    market, and dealer in animals. The youth had to dip himself in the water
                    also, and was changed into a small sea-hare. The merchant went into the
                    town, and showed the pretty little animal, and many persons gathered
                    together to see it. At length the king's daughter came likewise, and as
                    she liked it very much, she bought it, and gave the merchant a good deal
                    of money for it. Before he gave it over to her, he said to it, when the
                    king's daughter goes to the window, creep quickly under the braids of her
                    her hair. And now the time arrived when she was to search for him.
