                    <b> She went to one window after another in turn,</b> from the first to
                    the eleventh, and did not see him. When she did not see him from the
                    twelfth either, she was full of anxiety and anger, and shut it down with
                    such violence that the glass in every window shivered into a thousand
                    pieces, and the whole castle shook. She went back and felt the sea-hare
                    beneath the braids of her hair. Then she seized it, and threw it on the
                    ground exclaiming, away with you, get out of my sight. It ran to the
                    merchant, and both of them hurried to the spring, wherein they plunged,
                    and received back their true forms. The youth thanked the fox, and said,
                    the raven and the fish are idiots compared with you, you know the right
                    tune to play, there is no denying that.
