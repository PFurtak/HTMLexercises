                    <b> Next day</b> he went to the lake, called the fish to him and said, I
                    suffered you to live, now tell me where to hide myself so that the king's
                    daughter may not see me. The fish thought for a while, and at last cried,
                    I have it, I will shut you up in my stomach. He swallowed him, and went
                    down to the bottom of the lake. The king's daughter looked through her
                    windows, and even from the eleventh did not see him, and was alarmed, but
                    at length from the twelfth she saw him. She ordered the fish to be caught
                    and killed, and then the youth appeared. It is easy to imagine the state
                    of mind he was in. She said, twice you are forgiven, but be sure that your
                    head will be set on the hundredth post.
