                    <b> The youth went straight to the palace.</b> The princess was already
                    expecting him, and abandoned herself to her fate. The wedding was
                    solemnized, and now he was king, and lord of all the kingdom. He never
                    told her where he had concealed himself for the third time, and who had
                    helped him, so she believed that he had done everything by his own skill,
                    and she had a great respect for him, for she thought to herself, he is
                    able to do more than I.
